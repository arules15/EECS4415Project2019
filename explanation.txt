how to start the flask server
to start the flask server, one needs to do 2 things
1. start the python venv: in a terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command
for windows: flaskenv\Scripts\activate
for unix: source venv/bin/activate

after the virtual environment has been started, run the following 2 commands to start the flask server 
export FLASK_APP=server.py
flask run

the server will become available at localhost:5000

How to edit files
our main file will be the routes file, this file will recieve api requests with data to run analysis with
Example of handling a request in flask

@application.route('/Handler/<int:QueryStringFromApplication>', methods=['GET'])
def handlingFunction(QueryStringFromApplication):
    #pass parameters to some function and use jsonify to convert to JSON string and return to application
the @ symbol will invoke the function directly below it when the api endpoint /Handler/<int:QueryStringFromApplication> 
gets hit wih a get request, the <int:QueryStringFromApplication> portion is our way of specifying that this endpoint expects
to recieve a integer as input, which we can then pass to our function as a parameter

The Idea is to have a seperate file handling each specific task (youtube queries, steam queries, steam dataset operations etc.) So that everything isnt just in one file, we'll then import those files into the routes file and call there functions neatly

Hopefully more will be added to this document as we discover more about flask
