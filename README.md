It is no secret that the video game industry today is growing at a staggering rate and is worth more than the film and music industries 
combined in terms of revenue - generating upwards of 100 billion dollars per year globally. Companies looking to cash in have many 
important decisions to make before developing a game and entering into the market. These decisions can make or break the success of a game 
and include selecting a genre, price, engine and platforms to support. In this decision making process, it can be unclear which choices 
will bring positive, profitable results after only a manual, surface-level inspection of current trends. Our solution uses Apache Spark 
amongst other tools to aggregate data and present time series results and other metrics in real time. This data is sourced from relevant 
gaming platforms and news outlets including the Steam Store, Youtube, and Pcgamer. This approach aims to provide accurate analytics from 
which companies can derive insights and make informed decisions.
