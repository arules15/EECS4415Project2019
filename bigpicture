Youtube:
for each game in genre:
 - scrape youtube videos
 for each month:
    - if video is from that month then
        - compute like-dislike ratio, calculate new average
        - get the views of the video, calculate new average
 - at the end we have a table: game, month, avg like/dislike, avg views

then combine all the averages of all the games for each column to get this table:
genre, month, avg views, avg like/dislike

We can graph avg views over time, like/dislike over time, avg views over like/dislike

Pcgamer:
for each month:
 for each article in that month: (pass 1)
    - get word count of all games mentioned and save it for later
    - we now have a table of article word counts: month, game1wc, game2wc, game3wc
 calculate total word counts for each game for each month
 for each article in that month: (pass 2)
    - we now have the table from pass 1 and the total word counts for each game for each month
    - get sentiment value for each article
    for each game:
        - game sentiment += (gamewc in article) / (total word count for all articles in month) * article sentiment
    - we now have a table: game, month, sentiment
    - sum up the sentiment of all games in genre.
genre, month, avg sentiment,

In total we have the following:

genre, month, avg views, avg like/dislike, avg pcgamer sentiment
